# Automatic Improvement Splitting

This script contains a few bash functions to help automate the process of splitting improvements to a different branch.

## Setup

## Usage
1. As you find improvements, tag them with the `gcmi` command. This is still a normal commit, so you can add a message.
```sh 
$ git add lib/file-with-unrelated-changes.ex
$ gcmi "Fix ordering of statement"
```
2. When you are ready to split the improvements use the `gsi` command. You should specify the name of the improvements branch.
```sh
$ gsi hg/random-improvements
```

All of the improvements should have been moved the selected branch.
