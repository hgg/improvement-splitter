# Automatic Improvement Splitting

This script contains a few bash functions to help automate the process of splitting improvements to a different branch. They

## Setup
We've added an script for setting up the functions, but they can easily be added manually to your existing alias file or even directly on your shell profile (please don't :sweat_smile:)

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the `setup.sh` script to set up new functions/alias
```bash
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```
3. Restart your terminal

The setup script currently supports:
* Zsh 
  * Uses the Oh-my-zsh custom folder when applicable
* Bash
  
## Usage
1. As you find improvements, tag them with the `gcmi` command. This is still a normal commit, so you can add a message.
```sh 
$ git add lib/file-with-unrelated-changes.ex
$ gcmi "Fix ordering of statement"
```
2. When you are ready to split the improvements use the `gsi` command. You should specify the name of the improvements branch.
```sh
$ gsi hg/random-improvements
```

All of the improvements should have been moved the selected branch.
